# cvs-comprator
# CSV Comparator

## Overview
This is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application built using `tkinter` that allows users to compare two CSV files and identify matching rows. It is particularly useful for comparing hash lists, such as those generated by FTK Imager, with a desired hash list.

## Features
- Allows users to select two CSV files for comparison.
- Compares the data row by row and highlights matching rows.
- Saves the matching rows to a new CSV file (`comparison_result.csv`).
- Displays progress using a progress bar.
- Provides error handling and user-friendly messages.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `tkinter`, `pandas`, `threading`

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python script.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the application by running the script.
2. Click the **Browse** button to select the first CSV file (FTK Imager hash list).
3. Click the **Browse** button to select the second CSV file (desired hash list to compare).
4. Click the **Submit** button to start the comparison.
5. Wait for the progress bar to complete. If matching rows are found, they will be saved in `comparison_result.csv`.
6. A message box will confirm the completion of the comparison process.

## Code Breakdown
- **File Selection:** Uses `filedialog.askopenfilename()` to allow users to select CSV files.
- **Data Loading:** Reads CSV files using `pandas.read_csv()`.
- **Comparison Logic:** Uses `df1.eq(df2).all(axis=1)` to find matching rows.
- **Progress Bar:** Updates the progress dynamically as rows are compared.
- **Threading:** Uses `threading.Thread` to prevent the GUI from freezing during comparison.
- **Error Handling:** Displays appropriate messages in case of errors.

## Potential Enhancements
- Allow selection of output directory for the comparison results.
- Implement column-wise comparison instead of full row matching.
- Improve UI with additional styling and feedback indicators.
